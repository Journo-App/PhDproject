Political Economy: 
How media and communication systems and content are shaped by ownership, market structures, commercial support, 
technologies, labor practices, and government policies. This definition builds on the relationship of the political 
and economic to each other and, more widely, social and cultural life. 

How media and communication systems and content are shaped by ownership, market structures, commercial support, technologies, labor practices, and government policies. The political economy of media links the media and communications systems to how both economic and political systems work, and how social power is exercised, in society. How is political power exercised? What structures and policies generate the media institutions, practices and system most conducive to self-government? And what are the options for citizens to not only exercise self-government but shape policies to support that end?
